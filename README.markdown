## Color Kata

### Getting Started
* install Ruby 2.2 or newer
* run `bundle install`

### The Problem

In an imaginary app, we have the need to convert between an RGB color and a CMYK color. Thankfully, there is a 'library' (`color_kata/converter.rb`) that already does this for us, but the interface is a bit unwieldy to use.

### Instructions Recap:
* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec rspec` to run specs for Part I
* Once you complete Part I, commit and run `bundle exec rake checkpoint`
* `bundle exec rspec` to run specs for Part II
